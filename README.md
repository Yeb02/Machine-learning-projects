ML tinkering


1- src is the python-3.X compatible version of the same file from the neural-networks-and-deeplearning repo, used in Nielsen's book.

2- equitheta and scanner_3D_version_phone are an attempt at SLAM on any device with a camera and an IP adress, without projective geometry.
It failed.

3- number_reading_live does what it says, using the scanner_live source from the 'tools' repo and a modified version of Nielsen's first network, from http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com.
